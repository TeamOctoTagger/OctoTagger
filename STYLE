# Style

All python code needs to follow the PEP8 style guidelines.
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

To check if your code is compliant, use the `flake8` utility, which can be
installed via `pip`. Some editors also have this functionality built-in. It is
important to note that `flake8` is usually stricter than editors.

Function arguments should either be written on one line,
    do_stuff(1, 2, 3)
or each on a separate line
    do_stuff(
        1,
        2,
        3,
    )
but NOT mixed!
    do_stuff(1, 2
             3)
Also remember the final comma after the last element.

In case you need to split a string across multiple lines enclose it in
parentheses (remember the spaces):
    (
        "This is a string "
        "that is continued on this line"
    )

# Structure

Bigger classes (e.g. ItemView) should reside in their files with the same name
(e.g. itemview.py). If there are multiple smaller classes with similar
functionality, they should be put in the same file (e.g. dialogs).

# Naming

When subclassing a wx class, all functions should follow their naming style of
capitalized word (i.e. DoStuff).

Variables and non-wx functions should be lowercase with underscore (i.e.
do_stuff).

# Logic

Prefer raising an exception instead of silently failing.
See https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html for a list of built-in
exceptions.
