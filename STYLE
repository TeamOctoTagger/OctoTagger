All python code needs to follow the PEP8 style guidelines.

To check if your code is compliant, use the `flake8` utility, which can be
installed via `pip`. Some editors also have this functionality built-in.

In case you need to split a string accross multiple lines do it like this:
    (
        "This is a string "
	"that is continued on this line"
    )
or like this:
    ("This is a string "
     "that is continued on this line")
